### Gecko Toolbox 1.0 Release

This is not a complete framework, is a set of tools that work on 
top of Zend Framework, the idea is to use these tools, as mere
helpers for RAID development on ZF.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

- Zend Framework 1
- PHP 5.3+

## CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH

You need to add the `library/` directory to your include path,
it can be global or on a per-project basis.

You can find out more about the PHP `include_path`
configuration directive here:
